# Email from Gmail

## How to use
create a `email_config.py` file and make a `user` variable and set it to your email address (eg. `user = johndoe@gmail.com`)
then make an app password for you gmail account if you dont already have one, then set a `password` variable to your app password
then run `python main.py` and it should work

## General rules on how to edit the code
no more then 3 indents (the indent from declaring a function doesnt count) you can look at my code to see ways to limit your indents
use `+=` rather than `a = a + b` and dont also you dont have to comment no literally everything just use good variable names and function names but if something isnt totally clear
then use a quick comment
